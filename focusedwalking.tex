\play{5 or more}
\\*
Everyone stands around the edge of the space.  Each person picks a point on the opposite side and begins walking towards it.  Players use their peripheral vision to avoid bumping into other players, changig speed slightly wherever possible rather than stopping to let others pass.  Each time the person reaches their point, they turn and pick a new point to walk to.\\*
Variations include:\\*
Changing Speed\\*
Flocking - any player chooses an action to do while walking, such as putting their arm up, scracthing their head etc.  When other players see them doing this, they mirror their action.\\*
Name Calling - a player's name is called out, and everyone has to stop and point at them without looking to see where they are (good for remembering names, and for keeping a map of everyone in your peripheral vision).\\*
Character - an animal, object style etc is called out, and all players must move in the same way as that character.\\*
Trust - Players at random call out their name and an action they wish to be doing - falling, flying, swimming etc.  The other players rush to them, catch and support them, and move them in the action they called out.\\*
Distraction - Choose a handful of players (no more than $1/3$).  These players try to distract and interfere with the others (without touching them) by making noises, pulling faces, or telling jokes.  The other players should try not break focus while this is going on around them.\\*
